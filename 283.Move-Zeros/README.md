Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

Note:

1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

2. Minimize the total number of operations.

Segregate 0s and 1s in an array

You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order. Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array. Traverse array only once.

Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] 

Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] 

Method 1 (Count 0s or 1s) 
Thanks to Naveen for suggesting this method.
1) Count the number of 0s. Let count be C.
2) Once we have count, we can put C 0s at the beginning and 1s at the remaining n â€“ C positions in array.

Time Complexity: O(n)

The method 1 traverses the array two times. Method 2 does the same in a single pass.

Method 2 (Use two indexes to traverse)
Maintain two indexes. Initialize first index left as 0 and second index right as n-1.

Do following while left < right
a) Keep incrementing index left while there are 0s at it
b) Keep decrementing index right while there are 1s at it
c) If left < right then exchange arr[left] and arr[right]

More general:

Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0] 

Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
